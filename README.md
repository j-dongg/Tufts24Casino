All games are integrated into our GitHub repository, allowing you to play directly from the terminal.

Detailed instructions and game rules are provided within the terminal to ensure a pristine gaming experience.
Get ready for an exhilarating time at Group G's Casino, where fortune favors the bold! Happy gambling!

## Using the GUI:
Though we're all new to Python, we were able to make an MVP GUI for our Casino. Like our terminal games, it features a starting balance of $10,000 and has options for slots and blackjack (no roulette, unfortunately). Select a game, enter your bet, and play. 
Notes on playing:
* At any time, press Escape to return to the choose-mode screen. Your balance will remain updated.
* At the end of a game, press Y to play again. Blackjack tells you this but the slot machine doesn't (neglectable troubleshooting change we forgot to take out before zipping).
* With the time we had, we weren't able to make anything happen if you ran out of money. Close out of the game if such an event occurs. 


To write a comprehensive README for the GitHub repository shown in your screenshot, which is titled "Tufts24Casino" and contains several Python scripts for casino games and associated resources, hereâ€™s a suggested format and content:

## How to Play:
